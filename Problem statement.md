AI-Worker is a voice-first desktop workspace designed to revolutionize productivity by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with everyday applications and files using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). We are currently in the active MVP development stage, providing high-performance orchestration via secure cloud-based LLM connectivity.


Problem Statement
AI assistants are siloed and text-heavy.
Lack of seamless integration with enterprise tools.
Privacy concerns with cloud-only data exposure.


The Solution
A universal bridge using MCP to connect state-of-the-art LLMs (Cloud) to local apps. This hybrid model ensures maximum capability today while architecting for a local-first future.


Compute Strategy
"If users' systems are capable of running local LLMs, and with the anticipated availability of lightweight machine-runnable LLMs (e.g., Chrome Gemini Nano or Phi models on Chrome and Edge browsers), AI-Worker will support fully privacy-focused operation locally at that time."
